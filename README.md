## Intro
This is a web app created by my IBM Accelerate team and I in the summer of 2021 for our first team lab! 🎉<br /> 
Credits go to my awesome team: **@hkcountryman** **@madison2023** **@Sirenaaaa** **@lbrad543**<br /> 

> For this project, we utilized React, JavaScript, and MaterialUI. As this was a frontend exercise, no backend was implemented. (However, I intend to expand on our work and implement a backend to allow for data persistence!)

## My Specific Contribution
+ Designed the bulk of MaterialUI component placement with usage and ease-of-use in mind
+ Built the framework for basic task creation, sending data from nested components through props/passed functions
+ Implemented the ability to edit each task item with as little hassle as possible ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20621545/125178902-e69b8900-e19d-11eb-81fc-e01e000e926f.png)
+ Implemented the notification system to provide clear feedback to users ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20621545/125178917-0e8aec80-e19e-11eb-96c9-e6152a6b4d57.png)
